<p>You should start working on the <a href=\"http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/the_thirdworld_squat\">Third World Squat<a/> and <a href=\"http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/soft_tissue_work_for_tough_guys\">foam rolling</a>.</p><p>Perform a couple of sets of light curls before starting to squat. Warming up your hamstrings in this way can help you activate them at the bottom of a squat. Whenever you squat, make sure your weight stays on your heels throughout. If your weight shifts towards the front of your foot as you squat, you may need to strengthen your abdominal and hip flexor muscles. <a href=\"http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BBFrontSquat.html\">Front Squats</a> can help with stability as well.</p><p>Practice the third world squat multiple times a day, holding on to support if you have to. Add foam rolling into your warmup, and don't be surprised if it hurts like hell in the beginning. Be patient, because when it comes to flexibility, progress is measured in months.</p>
